               Distributed Denial of Service is an attack in which multiple systems flood a targeted server or network with traffic, overwhelming it and causing it to stop responding to legitimate requests.

               A type of DoS attack that uses a high-and-fast approach, meaning it sends a large volume of traffic to a target server or website in a short period of time. This overwhelming traffic also leads to a denial of service.

            <Typography>
               A type of DoS attack that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the HTTP protocol. It sends incomplete HTTP requests to a server or website, keeping the connection open and tying up server resources until the connection times out.

            <Typography>
               A type of DoS attack that uses a low-and-slow approach, meaning it sends small amounts of traffic at a slow rate to a target server or website. This makes it difficult for the target to distinguish between legitimate traffic and malicious traffic, ultimately leading to a denial of service.

               A type of DoS attack that also exploits a vulnerability in the HTTP protocol. It sends incomplete HTTP requests to a server or website, but instead of keeping the connection open, it sends more incomplete requests, gradually tying up the server resources.
